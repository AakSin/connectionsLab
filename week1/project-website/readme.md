# Wireframe
<img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe" width="400"/>

I sketeched a basic wireframe of the site on a sheet of paper. I wanted the heading on the side, the main text in the middle and the image on the side. I wanted to go for somethign simiple and neat. The color scehme would refelcet the color scheme of the Figma prototype I had chosen - white, black, red.

# Process

I used flexbox primarily for laying out the grid of the site. As I wasn't using CSS grid I had to use multiple nested flexbox containers to come upon my desired layout. For the nav bar I did CSS animations to make it enlarge on hovering. The title text was laid out in vertical align. I only displayed 1 image because that's the layout I liked. If we were using Javascript I would have preferred to make a slideshow of the images.

# Learning

In the class, I learnt I had done a mistake in writing the classes out. I had written them as "#classname" instead of just "classname". I will double check my code. I should have also gone ahead and used CSS grids instead of Flexbox, as the layout became very complicated with just Flexbox in it. I would have liked to find out more way to integrate images in the site.
