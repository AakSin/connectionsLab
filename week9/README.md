# Symphonizer
## Inspiration

The project was inpsired by <a href="https://patatap.com/">Patatap</a>. We decided to create a real time multiplayer version of it using Socket.js
## Planning, prototyping
We first started sketching out some basic prototypes and the socket's flow chart for this project. After going over a few basic designs we shifted the prototype to Figma.

## Coding

Marta has been working on the p5.js animations on the p5 editor so far, while I have been setting up sockets.
